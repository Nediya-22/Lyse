# Multimodal Functionalization of 2D Nanomaterials through Computational Design for Targeted Cancer Therapy

## Project Overview

This repository centers on the **computational engineering of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials** tailored for **multimodal cancer therapy**. The study aims to model and enhance the **photothermal**, **photodynamic**, and **catalytic** behaviors of functionalized 2D systems such as MoS₂, WS₂, and MoGe₂P₄. Grounded in **solid-state physics**, the work utilizes **density functional theory (DFT)**, **molecular dynamics (MD)**, and **data-driven optimization techniques** to explore structure–property relationships. Advanced **predictive modeling tools** are also incorporated to identify optimal material designs for therapeutic efficacy.

## Goals

* Model and functionalize promising 2D nanomaterials (e.g., MoS₂, MoGe₂P₄)
* Simulate their photothermal and photodynamic responses
* Optimize surface modifications for enhanced therapeutic efficiency
* Evaluate interactions with anticancer drugs and tumor microenvironments
* Use pattern recognition and predictive algorithms to accelerate design cycles

## Tools & Methods

* **Quantum ESPRESSO / VASP** for DFT calculations
* **LAMMPS / GROMACS** for molecular dynamics
* **FDTD** simulations for optical absorption modeling
* **Data-driven strategies** including surrogate modeling, regression analysis, and dimensionality reduction for screening and optimizing candidate materials
* **Clustering and classification techniques** to map structure-function relationships
